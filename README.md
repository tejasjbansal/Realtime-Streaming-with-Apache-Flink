# Real-Time E-Commerce Analytics Pipeline
Welcome to the Apache Flink E-Commerce Analytics project! This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering solution leveraging Apache Flink, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and Postgres to build a real-time data pipeline for e-commerce analytics.

## Project Description
In this project, we delve into the world of real-time data processing and analytics using cutting-edge technologies. We build a robust and scalable data pipeline that processes financial transaction data in real-time and provides insights using Elasticsearch and Postgres for storage.

## Application Details
The Main class in the Flink package serves as the main entry point for our Flink application. This application:
  1.Consumes financial transaction data from Kafka topics.
  2.Performs various transformations on the data stream by using Apache Flink.
  3.Stores aggregated results into both Postgres and Elasticsearch for further analysis and visualization.
